      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I've been at the Pacific Science Center for about 4 years, where I've gone from just dabbling in web development on personal projects to building custom apps and WordPress plugins to address internal business needs.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Born in Washington, lived in California, Guam, Massachusetts, Virginia, and finally back to Washington.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Learning and making things. Web design/development, paper & clay crafts, and most recently I've been teaching myself 3D modeling.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Web developer for an educational institute / organization, such as the Exploratorium (CA), Mystery.org or even possibly the Pacific Science Center. I'd love to implement/support/build on a learning management system (LMS) as well as create interactives and develop/improve on ways to present content in an engaging way.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Everett, WA</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I love learning new things and building things - especially anything that other people can interact with and enjoy. If they can learn something at the same time, even better!</p>
